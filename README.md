# LOTS-IAM implemented on GPU
LOTS-IAM-GPU is a fast and fully-automatic unsupervised detection of irregular textures of white matter hyperintensities (i.e. WMH) on MR image. LOTS-IAM-GPU is an abbreviation of Limited One-time Sampling Irregularity Age Map (LOTS-IAM) on GPU.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project is written in Python (3.6.5). Below is the list of minimum prerequisites for running the project. Please note that versions of prerequisties are listed to inform user of the tested environment.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
